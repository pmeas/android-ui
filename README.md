![Portable Multi-Effect Audio Software](docs/PMEAS_logo.png "PMEAS")

## Description
This is the **Android** mobile application designed to work with the [PMEAS backend application](https://github.com/pmeas/pmeas-backend "PMEAS Backend"). This application allows the user to perform multiple functionalities that are available in the official [frontend application](https://github.com/pmeas/pmeas-frontend "PMEAS frontend"). The application serves as a barebones model for how one could go about implementing (or extending from this project) a custom application to work with the backend application.

This is one component of several components that comprise the PMEAS system. Find the other components [here](https://github.com/pmeas "PMEAS Project"). 

## Supported Functionality
At present the following functionality is supported by the Android application:
* Adding and deleting all functional events
* Modifying all parameters for each effect.
* Changing the playback and capture ports for the backend to use.
